Artificial vision based voice assist system that helps thee blind people in their daily lives



ABSTRACT:
We came up with a simple and cost-effective solution to solve this problem faced by the Blind people. We designed Artificial vision based voice assist system that has the following features
1. Conveys the info about hurdle in front of user by voice output.
2. Can detect the distance from the hurdle and assist in advance when suitable              command given to voice assists.  
3. Can assist the user with the path to move and conveys by voice out 
4. Can detect temperature and conveys by voice out when suitable command given to voice assist.
    This process is done by using a good resolute camera(web cam) in which  Open Computer vision is used up on the basic mobile netSSD data set which contain images  of particular object stored in feasible fashion. We used  the C-NN (congugational â€“neural network)algorithm for the feature excraction from the images and matching it to provided spontaneous image. An ultra sonic sensor is used to calculate the distance from the object infront of user .The clincic role of Open cv in the project is to provided a frame for work the image and detect. MPU6050 used to locate the objects exactly based on the head position .
 By following above process a well efficient system that purely focused on blind people is developed in a cost effective and efficient manner.
